    <h1>Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on
         the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!” 
         When the villagers heard the cry, they ran up the hill to drive the wolf away. But when they 
         arrived, they saw no wolf. </h1>
